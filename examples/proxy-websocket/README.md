# Reverse Proxy (WebSocket)

## Overview

This example runs a reverse-proxy server and proxy [websocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) requesnt and response.
Websocket is one of the streaming type requests and responses.

## Config

Configuration yaml to run a reverse-proxy server for websocket would becomes as follows.
This config is almost the same as plain reverse-proxy except for the upstream url.

```yaml
# config.yaml

apiVersion: core/v1
kind: Entrypoint
spec:
  runners:
    - apiVersion: core/v1
      kind: HTTPServer

---
apiVersion: core/v1
kind: HTTPServer
spec:
  addr: ":8080"
  virtualHosts:
    - handlers:
        - handler:
            apiVersion: core/v1
            kind: ReverseProxyHandler

---
apiVersion: core/v1
kind: ReverseProxyHandler
spec:
  loadBalancers:
    - pathMatcher:
        match: "/"
        matchType: Prefix
      upstreams:
        - url: http://localhost:9090
```

The config tells:

- Start a `HTTPServer` with port 8080.
- ReverseProxy is applied for the path having prefix `/` (matches all).
- Upstream service is [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) (This url is defined in server.go).

This graph shows the resource dependencies of the configuration.

  Entrypoint["ðŸŸª **Entrypoint**</br>default/default"]
  HTTPServer["ðŸŸª **HTTPServer**</br>default/default"]
  ReverseProxyHandler["ðŸŸ¥ **ReverseProxyHandler**</br>default/default"]

Entrypoint --> HTTPServer
HTTPServer --> ReverseProxyHandler
ReverseProxyHandler

## Run

### (Option 1) Directory run the binary

First run the AILERON Gateway with the sample config as follows.

```bash
./aileron -f ./config.yaml
```

We also runs the upstream websocket server using [server.go](server.go).

Run the server with this command.
The server will listens on the port `:9090` by default.

```bash
go run server.go
```

### (Option 2) Use taskfile

`Taskfile.yaml` is available to run the example.
Install [go-task](https://taskfile.dev/) and run the following command.

```bash
task
```

or with arbitrary binary path.

```bash
task AILERON_CMD="./path/to/aileron/binary"
```

This runs both AILERON Gateway and the upstream server.

## Check

After running a reverse-proxy server and upstream server,
we check websocket requests and responses are proxied.

Access [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) from a browser.
The server returns index.html that works as a websocket client.

Once accessed the url, client connects to the websocket server
and the server returns the current datetime every seconds.

You can send a message to the server with the form.
The upstream websocket server will echoes your message.
