# Vanilla Server

## Overview

This example runs a vanilla server.
A vanilla-server does not have any feature but returns 404 NotFound.

AILERON Gateway supports running multiple servers in a single process.

**Legend**:

- ðŸŸ¥ `#ff6961` Handler resources.
- ðŸŸ© `#77dd77` Middleware resources (Server-side middleware).
- ðŸŸ¦ `#89CFF0` Tripperware resources (Client-side middleware).
- ðŸŸª `#9370DB` Other resources.

In this example, following directory structure and files are supposed.

```txt
vanilla-server/           ----- Working directory.
â”œâ”€â”€ aileron               ----- AILERON Gateway binary (aileron.exe on windows).
â”œâ”€â”€ config-single.yaml    ----- AILERON Gateway config file for single server.
â””â”€â”€ config-multiple.yaml  ----- AILERON Gateway config file for multiple servers.
```

## Config

Configuration yaml to run multiple vanilla servers would becomes as follows.
Config for a single server would be more simple than this (See the config-single.yaml).

```yaml
# config-multiple.yaml

{{% github-raw "config-multiple.yaml" %}}
```

The config tells:

- Start 3 `HTTPServer` with port 8081, 8082 and 8083.
- Each server has their name `server1`, `server2` and `server3`.
- No other features are applied.

This graph shows the resource dependencies of the configuration.

```mermaid
graph TD
  Entrypoint["ðŸŸª **Entrypoint**</br>default/default"]
  HTTPServer1["ðŸŸª **HTTPServer**</br>default/server1"]
  HTTPServer2["ðŸŸª **HTTPServer**</br>default/server2"]
  HTTPServer3["ðŸŸª **HTTPServer**</br>default/server3"]

  Entrypoint --"Runner"--> HTTPServer1
  Entrypoint --"Runner"--> HTTPServer2
  Entrypoint --"Runner"--> HTTPServer3
```

## Run

Run the AILERON Gateway with command:

```bash
./aileron -f ./config-multiple.yaml
```

## Check

After running servers, send HTTP requests to it.

A json response will be returned when the vanilla servers are correctly running.
Note that the vanilla servers returns **404 NotFound** because no handlers are registered to them.

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8081
{"status":404,"statusText":"Not Found"}
```

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8082
{"status":404,"statusText":"Not Found"}
```

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8083
{"status":404,"statusText":"Not Found"}
```
