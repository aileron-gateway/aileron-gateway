# HTTP3 Sever Example

This folder is the example of a http3 server.
Browsers do not always use http3 but also use HTTP2.
If you have noticed that the browser you are using does not use http3, try to change your browsers.
We have checked that the Firefox uses http3.

**NOTICE: HTTP3 will be used for untrusted certificates.**
**Self-signed certs won't work with HTTP3
HTTP3 uses Quic protocol at transport layer.
AILERON uses [quic-go](https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go) for communication.

For logging and debugging quic, see the link below.
Environmental variable `QUIC_GO_LOG_LEVEL=debug` shows debug logs about Quic.

## Run

Run the command to start a http3 server.

```bash
./aileron -f _example/http3-server/
```

## Test

We use [curl with HTTP3](https://curl.se/docs/http3.html) to test the http3 server.
Send a request to [https://localhost:8443/](https://localhost:8443/).

See [TLS Certificate Verification](https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html) for additional curl TLS options.

```bash
$ curl --insecure --http3-only https://127.0.0.1:8443/get

{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/8.11.1",
    "X-Amzn-Trace-Id": "Root=1-67a5f2cc-7b0996055869a3b8511458e9",
    "X-Forwarded-Host": "127.0.0.1:8443"
  },
  "origin": "127.0.0.1, 106.73.5.65",
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8443/get"
}
```

## Notice

When you get an error like below, visit the url as mentioned and follow the step there.

- [https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/wiki/UDP-Buffer-Sizes](https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/wiki/UDP-Buffer-Sizes).

```text
failed to sufficiently increase receive buffer size (was: 208 kiB, wanted: 2048 kiB, got: 416 kiB). See https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/wiki/UDP-Buffer-Sizes for details.
```

## About certificates

The default certificates are generated by the following command.

- [./pki/server.crt](./pki/server.crt)
- [./pki/server.key](./pki/server.key)

```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -days 36500 -subj '/CN=aileron/O=aileron' -keyout server.key -out server.crt
```

Certificates have to be trusted by browsers when accessing from browsers.
[https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) is one of the useful tools that can generate SSL certificate.
Replacer the default cert and key with the generated one.

```bash
# Example commands to generate certificates using mkcert.
mkcert -install
mkcert example.com "*.example.com" example.test localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```
